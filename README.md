# üé¨ MovieVec - A Movie Semantic Search Engine

A high-performance semantic search engine for movies using state-of-the-art embedding models and FAISS indexing. Search through hundreds of thousands of movies using natural language queries with advanced cross-encoder re-ranking for superior accuracy.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Semantic Search**: Natural language queries like "crime movie with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro"
- **Cross-Encoder Re-ranking**: Advanced two-stage retrieval for maximum accuracy
- **FAISS Integration**: Fast similarity search with GPU acceleration
- **Comprehensive Movie Data**: Search across titles, plots, cast, crew, and genres
- **Optimized Performance**: Memory-efficient processing for large-scale datasets

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system uses a two-stage retrieval architecture:

1. **Stage 1 - Bi-Encoder + FAISS**: Fast initial retrieval of candidates
2. **Stage 2 - Cross-Encoder**: Precise re-ranking based on query-document interactions

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- 8GB+ RAM
- 5GB+ free disk space

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pkyria/MovieVec-Semantic-Search.git
   cd MovieVec-Semantic-Search
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For GPU acceleration (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Replace faiss-cpu with faiss-gpu if you have CUDA
   pip install faiss-gpu-cu12
   ```

3. **Download datasets**
   
   **Option A: Movie Details CSV (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Download from Google Drive link
   # Place in data/movie_details.csv
   ```
   
   **Option B: TMDB Dataset from Kaggle**
   ```bash
   # Download TMDB_movie_dataset_v11 from Kaggle
   # https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies
   # Place in data/TMDB_movie_dataset_v11/
   ```

### Usage

1. **Run Search queries and build the search index** (one-time initialization of embeddings and faiss index)
   ```bash
   cd src
   python main.py
   ```


2. **Interactive search example** (Search queries once engine is running. Type 'quit' to terminate the process.)
   ```
   Search: crime movie with robert de niro and al pacino
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Key settings in `src/config.py`:

```python
# Model Configuration
MODEL = 'all-mpnet-base-v2'  # Primary embedding model
CROSS_ENCODER = "cross-encoder/ms-marco-electra-base"  # Re-ranking model

# Performance Settings
DEVICE = 'cuda'  # or 'cpu'
BATCH_SIZE = 128

# FAISS Index Settings
INDEX_METRIC = 'IndexFlatIP'  # Options: IndexFlatL2, IndexFlatIP, IndexIVFFlat
IVFF_NLIST = 100  # For IndexIVFFlat clustering
```

## üîç Search Examples

The system excels at complex semantic queries:

```python
# Cast-based search
searcher.improved_search("crime movie with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro")

# Plot-based search
searcher.improved_search("movie about time travel with romantic subplot")

# Genre and setting
searcher.improved_search("sci-fi thriller taking place on a spaceship")

# Director and style
searcher.improved_search("Christopher Nolan mind-bending movie")
```

## üß† Model Details

### Primary Models

- **Embedding Model**: `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`
  - 768 dimensions
  - Optimized for English semantic similarity - Movie detail oriented (might contain foregin titles but the details are in English)
  - Excellent performance on movie/entertainment content

- **Cross-Encoder**: `cross-encoder/ms-marco-electra-base`
  - Advanced re-ranking for query-document pairs
  - Significant accuracy improvement over bi-encoder alone

### Performance Metrics

- **Index Building**: ~2-3 hours for 800K movies (with GPU)
- **Search Latency**: 
  - Total: ~2-4 seconds per query
- **Memory Usage**: ~4GB (index + models)

## üìä Dataset Information

### Movie Details CSV
- **Size**: 800K+ movies
- **Fields**: Title, Overview, Cast, Crew, Genres, Release Date, Popularity
- **Languages**: Foreign titles with English descriptions
- **Details**: Created from TMDB Dataset and API requests for Cast details on the most popular movies.
- **Download**: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t0NoADn3tP03vYNUrKa2EZMqBb5DwhI0/view?usp=sharing)

### TMDB Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle TMDB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies)
- **Size**: ~1,000,000 movies
- **Format**: Single CSV files
- **Processing**: Use `data/scraping.ipynb` for preprocessing

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Custom Model Configuration

```python
# In config.py, try different models:

# For multilingual support
MODEL = 'paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2'

# For faster inference
MODEL = 'all-MiniLM-L12-v2'

# For question-answering style queries
MODEL = 'multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1'
```

### Index Optimization

```python
# For large datasets, use approximate search
INDEX_METRIC = 'IndexIVFFlat'
IVFF_NLIST = 4096  # Adjust based on dataset size

# For maximum accuracy, use exact search
INDEX_METRIC = 'IndexFlatIP'
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA Out of Memory**
   ```python
   # Reduce batch size in config.py
   BATCH_SIZE = 32
   
   # Or use CPU
   DEVICE = 'cpu'
   ```

2. **FAISS GPU Transfer Failed**
   ```python
   # The system automatically falls back to CPU search
   # Check GPU memory usage
   ```

3. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   # Ensure all dependencies are installed
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Performance Optimization

- **GPU Memory**: Reserve 4-6GB for optimal performance
- **RAM**: 8GB+ recommended for large datasets
- **Storage**: SSD recommended for faster index loading
